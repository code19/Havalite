 HavaLite cms, a new liteweight Content Management System
 
 Hello and welcome

I had a good experience with great content management systems on the web but also bad experience with backing up my blog contents.There is for sure a lot of solutions in the internet but they never come in one piece. For this reason i decided to do things self instead of waiting that things are done. I hope you like the idea behind Havalite and i wish you good and easy blogging.

Thats it ;)
